# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to develop a heart disease prediction model using logistic regression. The model analyzes a set of input variables, such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking habits, to predict the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease.

Logistic regression is a straightforward and interpretable algorithm that can provide insights into the relationship between input variables and the likelihood of heart disease.
